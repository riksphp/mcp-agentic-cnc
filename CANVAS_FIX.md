# Canvas Visualization Fix

## Problem

When requesting visualization, the canvas window would open but nothing would appear until you:

1. Switched away from Preview
2. Came back to Preview
3. Or manually refreshed

This was caused by macOS Preview not detecting file changes automatically.

## Solution Applied

### What Was Changed

Modified `example_macp_server_mac.py` to force Preview to refresh:

#### 1. Added Helper Function (Line 145-152)

```python
def _force_preview_refresh(image_path: str):
    """Helper function to force Preview to reload the image."""
    # Close existing Preview window
    subprocess.run(["pkill", "-f", "Preview"], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    # Reopen the image
    subprocess.Popen(["open", image_path])
    time.sleep(0.3)
```

#### 2. Updated `refresh_canvas()` Function (Line 217-233)

- Now closes Preview before reopening
- Forces a complete reload of the image
- Ensures all drawn elements are immediately visible

### How It Works

**Old Behavior:**

```
open_canvas â†’ draw_rectangle â†’ add_text_in_paint â†’ refresh_canvas
                                                    â†“
                                          (Preview doesn't update)
```

**New Behavior:**

```
open_canvas â†’ draw_rectangle â†’ add_text_in_paint â†’ refresh_canvas
                                                    â†“
                                        (Close Preview â†’ Reopen)
                                                    â†“
                                        âœ… Shows all drawings immediately
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Visualization

```python
query = """Calculate ASCII values for HELLO, visualize on canvas with rectangle and text."""
```

**Expected behavior now:**

1. âœ… Canvas opens (blank white screen)
2. âœ… Agent draws rectangle (saved to file)
3. âœ… Agent adds text (saved to file)
4. âœ… Agent calls refresh_canvas
5. âœ… Preview closes and reopens automatically
6. âœ… You see rectangle + text immediately

### Full Test with Email

```python
query = """Calculate ASCII sum for TESTING, visualize it beautifully on canvas, and email result to rishi.shrma06@gmail.com with subject 'Visualization Test'."""
```

## Why This Happens

macOS Preview uses file caching to improve performance. When a file is already open:

- Preview doesn't automatically watch for file changes
- The `open` command on an already-open file does nothing
- You had to manually trigger a refresh by switching apps

**Solution:** Force close Preview and reopen it, which guarantees a fresh load of the file.

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

If you experience issues with the current fix, here are alternatives:

### Option 1: Add Delay

```python
# In refresh_canvas, increase sleep times
time.sleep(0.5)  # Instead of 0.2
time.sleep(0.8)  # Instead of 0.3
```

### Option 2: Auto-refresh After Each Draw

Modify `draw_rectangle` and `add_text_in_paint` to auto-refresh:

```python
# At end of draw_rectangle
_force_preview_refresh(canvas_image_path)
```

This would eliminate the need for a separate refresh_canvas call, but increases the number of Preview open/close cycles.

### Option 3: Use Different Viewer

Instead of Preview, use QuickLook:

```python
subprocess.Popen(["qlmanage", "-p", canvas_image_path])
```

## Troubleshooting

### Canvas Still Not Refreshing?

**Check 1: Permissions**
Ensure Python has permission to control Preview:

```bash
# System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility
# Add Terminal or your Python executable
```

**Check 2: Increase Delays**
Some Macs need more time:

```python
# In _force_preview_refresh helper function
time.sleep(0.5)  # Was 0.2
time.sleep(0.5)  # Was 0.3
```

**Check 3: Verify File Creation**

```bash
# Check if canvas file is being created
ls -la /tmp/mcp_canvas.png
```

**Check 4: Manual Test**

```bash
# Manually test the fix
python3 -c "
import subprocess, time
subprocess.run(['pkill', '-f', 'Preview'])
time.sleep(0.3)
subprocess.Popen(['open', '/tmp/mcp_canvas.png'])
"
```

### Preview Keeps Closing/Opening?

This is expected behavior with the fix. Each `refresh_canvas` call:

1. Closes Preview (if open)
2. Reopens it with the updated image

This ensures you see the latest drawings immediately.

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Only 0.5 seconds added per refresh
- **Trade-off**: Slightly longer but guaranteed visibility
- **Optimization**: The agent only calls refresh_canvas once at the end

## Reverting the Fix

If you want to revert to the old behavior:

```python
# Replace refresh_canvas with:
@mcp.tool()
async def refresh_canvas() -> dict:
    global canvas_app_open, canvas_image_path
    if not canvas_app_open:
        return {"content": [TextContent(type="text", text="Canvas not open")]}

    subprocess.Popen(["open", canvas_image_path])
    return {"content": [TextContent(type="text", text="Canvas refreshed")]}
```

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed:** Canvas now refreshes automatically and shows drawings immediately  
âœ… **Method:** Force close/reopen Preview  
âœ… **Impact:** +0.5s per refresh, guaranteed visibility  
âœ… **Tested:** Works with visualization queries
