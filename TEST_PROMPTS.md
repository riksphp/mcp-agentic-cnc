## üîß Configuration Tips

### To Use These Prompts:

1. **Copy any prompt** from above
2. **Edit line 214** in `talk2mcp.py`
3. **Replace the existing query** with your chosen prompt
4. **Customize:**
   - Change the word (e.g., `PYTHON` ‚Üí `YOUR_WORD`)
   - Change email address if needed
   - Change subject line
5. **Run:** `python3 talk2mcp.py`

### Example:

```python
# In talk2mcp.py, line 214:
query = """Calculate ASCII exponential sum for TESTING, visualize it, and email to rishi.shrma06@gmail.com with subject 'Test Complete'."""
```

---

## üìä Recommended Testing Order

Start with these in order:

1. **Test #1** (Math Only) - Verify basic calculation works
2. **Test #2** (Math + Viz) - Verify canvas works
3. **Test #3** (Math + Email) - Verify email works
4. **Test #4** (Everything) - Verify full integration
5. Then try **creative tests** (#9-11)
6. Finally try **edge cases** (#12-14)

---

## üéØ Quick Customization Template

```python
query = """
Calculate ASCII exponential sum for [YOUR_WORD],
[visualize it on canvas,]
[and] send [description] email to rishi.shrma06@gmail.com
with subject '[YOUR_SUBJECT]'
[including additional details you want].
"""
```

**Fill in:**

- `[YOUR_WORD]` - Any word to analyze
- `[visualize...]` - Include or remove
- `[description]` - a detailed/quick/professional/friendly
- `[YOUR_SUBJECT]` - Email subject
- `[including...]` - Any additional instructions

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Better Results:

- ‚úÖ Use **clear keywords**: "visualize", "email", "send to"
- ‚úÖ Be **specific** about what goes in the email
- ‚úÖ Include **subject line** in your prompt
- ‚úÖ Use **natural language** - the agent understands context
- ‚úÖ Test **incrementally** - start simple, add complexity

### Avoid:

- ‚ùå Vague instructions like "do something"
- ‚ùå Conflicting requests
- ‚ùå Missing email address when requesting email
- ‚ùå Too many tasks in one prompt (max 3-4 operations)
